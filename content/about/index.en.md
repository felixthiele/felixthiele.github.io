**Hello and welcome to my personal website! :wave:**

I'm Felix - IT Consultant, Software Architect and Team Lead from Cologne, Germany. 
During my computer science studies at the Technical University of Munich, I entered the field of IT consulting and have since gained over 10 years of experience in various roles within consulting projects. 

My expertise spans software development, mainly in Java and TypeScript, requirements and usability engineering, IT architecture, and project management. 
I have primarily worked with clients in the insurance and healthcare sectors.

Currently, I am a Senior Consultant at [INNOQ](https://www.innoq.com/en/), where I help clients with their IT architecture, organizational structures, platforms, and technology strategy.
