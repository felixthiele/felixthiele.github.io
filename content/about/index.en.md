During my computer science studies, I entered the field of IT consulting, accumulating 10 years of diverse experience in various roles within consulting projects. My expertise spans from Java and Javascript development, Requirements and Usability Engineering, to IT architecture and project management. I have predominantly served clients in the insurance and healthcare sectors.

Today, my focus at [INNOQ](https://www.innoq.com/en/) revolves around large IT architectures, organizational architecture, platforms, technology strategy and a lot of communication. I enjoy hands-on development in the Java & Javascript universe, deploying OCI containers in Kubernetes and OpenShift, and ensuring smooth automation.
